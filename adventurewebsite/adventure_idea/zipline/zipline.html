    <h2>What is Zip LINE?</h2><br>
    <h3><i>A zipline is a system of suspended cables mounted on a hill or slope. The cables are made of stainless steel and each one connects a higher landscape point to a lower point. Zipline adventure riders use a pulley system to ride across the stainless steel cables, and with the help of gravity, they can travel up to 30 mph! <br>

        Some people may be hesitant to give it a try, especially those who are afraid of heights, but it’s important to remember that our zip line adventure tours are very safe. You will be secured to the cables at all times, and our expert guides are certified and professionally-trained to ensure your safety throughout the tour.</i></h3><br>
