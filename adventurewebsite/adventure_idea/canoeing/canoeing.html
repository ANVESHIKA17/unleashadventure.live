    <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 7, 9);"><i>Water sports have really caught on with us travelers lately, and our trips seem incomplete without at least one activity in the water. As water-based activities gain popularity, you don't want to be left behind on this trend! Come, learn the tricks of canoeing, so you can have an even more immersive (literally ;-) ) experience on your next vacation!</i></h3><br>


    <h1><b><i>Not a swimmer? No problem! Canoeing is for you too! :-)</i></b></h1>

    <h3><i>Canoeing is essentially the art of manoeuvring a canoe, which is nothing but a sleek watercraft with pointed ends. You propel a canoe using two single-bladed paddles. Canoes come in various sizes and shapes that fit 1 to a maximum of 3 people. A canoe is small enough to be steered by a single pair of oars, by either 1 person or 2 people who take care of one side each.</i></h3><br>

    <h2><b>What To Wear </b></h2><br>
    <h3>For most water-sports, it is advisable to wear quick-dry clothes which don't get soaked. Lycra and spandex are good materials, better still to ensure the fabric is sweat-wicking and dry-fit. You will toil and your own sweat can make your outfit heavier, otherwise!  <br>

        Life-jacket should be your outermost layer. Do not underestimate the force of rivers! Even if you are a seasoned swimmer, river-currents can sometimes be too strong for you to even stay at one place. Life-jackets are also why non-swimmers can try canoeing without worrying at all. Proper jackets come with a padded float behind your back which acts as a head-rest, so you can sleep on the surface of water in case you fall of a canoe.  <br>
        
        The floating helmet is optional if you'll be canoeing away from rocks. </h3>
