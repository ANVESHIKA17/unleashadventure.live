    <title>Bungee Jumping</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h3> <i>  Gorgeous hilly terrains are an intrinsic part of Uttarakhand, and cannot be extricated out of the Rishikesh experience. The bungee jumping location is about few minute walk from the serene land.
        <br> Please note that the 15-20 minute walk up from the Recovery point, after your Bungy, to the Cafeteria, maybe strenuous for some, considering this is a hilly area but we urge you to take this in the spirit of Rishikesh adventure tour packages, and come prepared with sports shoes. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        This is a beautiful walk up nonetheless, amidst the wilderness of Rishikesh, and rest assured that we have made arrangements to make Bungee jumping places this as comfortable as possible, by providing 1 complementary bottle of water for the walk up, along with benches for a short rest, at regular intervals of the route. The bungee jumping prices are affordable and blended with other sports to make it more cost-effective. You can choose any one from the combos as per your need.!!!

      <h2>  Please note that entry to the bridge is allowed ONLY to jumpers. </h2>
<h3> <i></i>     Then, Jump with rubber chords tied to your ankles and feel the adrenalin rush like never before. After the Jump, the Jumpers are lowered down to a drop zone in the river which has only 2 ft of water, and an I’VE GOT GUTS badge is pinned onto your T-shirt to honor your feat! Walk up to the cafeteria, cool off with drinks and snacks while watching your Bungy video. You can buy your DVD and purchase some souvenirs to remember your Jumpin Heights experience, and you may even gift this experience to a close friend, in store, with all expenses paid in advance! Don’t forget to collect your Dare to Jump Certificate from us. </i></h3>
