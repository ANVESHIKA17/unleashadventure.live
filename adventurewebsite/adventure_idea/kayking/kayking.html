    <h1>What is Kayking</h1><br>
    <h2><i><b>Kayaking is a fun water sport. It involves the use of a kayak, a narrowboat with a double-blade paddle to move on water. The driver is supposed to navigate through the waterways by sitting face-forward and marching ahead with alternating side-to-side paddle strokes.

    <h1><b>The Best Season To Go For Kayking</b></h1>
    <h2><i><b>The most important thing to note down is the region of your kayaking trip since the weather varies according to each place. Also, kayaking is much easier and accessible in all seasons. But you must prefer warm weather for kayaking to cold weather. The seasons of spring, summer and autumn are perfect times to enjoy your kayaking trip. In sport and recreational kayaking, it allows you to explore regions or even opt for complex routes. The Winter season is very dangerous for kayaking trips. Not just the weather affects your physical activity but also the temperature of the water. In India, you can prefer the span of October/ November to May for the northern and eastern parts. In southern parts and Goa, a kayaking trip is suitable in all seasons.
